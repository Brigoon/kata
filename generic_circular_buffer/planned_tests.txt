CBF_New
    Arguments
        Element count
        Type
    Allocates structure
    Allocates buffer
    Returns pointer to structure
    Returns null if can't allocate structure
    Frees structure and returns null if can't allocate buffer

CBF_Delete
    No return
    Should free all memory allocated by CBF_New
    Takes pointer to CBF_BUFFER_T as argument

CBF_BUFFER_T
    Has
        Pointer to buffer   Initialized to  0th element of buffer
        Total Size                          (element count) * (type size)
        Size of type                        <-- That
        Pointer to read                     pointer to buffer
        Pointer to write                    pointer to buffer

CBF_ElementWrite
    Adds an element to the buffer
    Increments write pointer
    Write pointer should wrap around when reaching the end of the buffer
    Should return error when buffer is full
